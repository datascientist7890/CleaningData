# Purpose of Document

This document gives the code book for the Coursera Class Project for the course “Getting and Cleaning Data”. 
A code book should contain the following: (1) The variables used,	the data used, the transformations that were done to clean up the data.

# Background

The background for the project is best described at the following link: 
https://class.coursera.org/getdata-033/human_grading/view/courses/975117/assessments/3/submissions

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. 
You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script 
for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work 
that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. 
This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

# Experiment Conducted.

The experiment conducted (from the Read.me file) is described below:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 
we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments 
have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, 
where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
