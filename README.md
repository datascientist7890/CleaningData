# Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project

This repository describes the work I have been doing forthe Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data".

# Raw Data

There are a set of files that needed to processed and integrated into a large data frame.

There were test files and training files.

# run_analysis.R Code

The run_analysis.R code takes the test files and the training files and combines them.

After combining testing and training data, labels are added and only columns that have to do with mean and standard deviation are kept from the features. The features are the column names. Features are really measurements.

The end result of the run_analysis.R code will be a tidy data set containing the means of all the features (measurements) for each subject (person who participated in experiment) and per activity. This tidy dataset file tidy.txt, which can also be found in this repository.

# About the Code Book

The CodeBook.md file explains the variables used, the transformations performed on the data,  and the tidy data set,
